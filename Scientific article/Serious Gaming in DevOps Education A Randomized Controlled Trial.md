Title: Serious Gaming in DevOps Education: A Randomized Controlled Trial

Abstract:
This study investigates the effectiveness of serious gaming in teaching DevOps principles to software engineering students. We conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing traditional lecture-based learning with a custom-developed serious game. Results indicate significant improvements in both knowledge retention and practical skills among students who used the serious game, suggesting potential benefits of gamification in DevOps education.

1. Introduction

DevOps, an approach that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops), has become increasingly crucial in modern software engineering practices (Erich et al., 2017). However, teaching DevOps concepts effectively remains challenging due to the complex interplay of technical skills and collaborative mindsets required (Bobrov et al., 2020).

Serious gaming, the use of game design elements in non-game contexts, has shown promise in various educational domains (Landers, 2014). This study aims to evaluate the potential of serious gaming in DevOps education, addressing a gap in the literature on effective DevOps teaching methodologies.

Research Questions:
RQ1: Does a serious gaming approach improve knowledge retention of DevOps concepts compared to traditional teaching methods?
RQ2: Can serious gaming enhance practical DevOps skills among software engineering students?
RQ3: How does student engagement differ between serious gaming and traditional learning approaches in DevOps education?

2. Methodology

2.1 Participants
We recruited 120 third-year undergraduate software engineering students from a large public university. Participants were randomly assigned to either the control group (traditional learning) or the experimental group (serious gaming).

2.2 Materials
Control Group: Traditional lecture-based curriculum covering core DevOps concepts.
Experimental Group: Custom-developed serious game "DevOps Quest" incorporating key DevOps principles and practices.

2.3 Procedure
The study was conducted over an 8-week period:
Week 1: Pre-test assessment of DevOps knowledge and skills
Weeks 2-7: Intervention period (traditional learning or serious gaming)
Week 8: Post-test assessment and engagement survey

2.4 Measures
- Knowledge retention: 50-item multiple-choice test on DevOps concepts
- Practical skills: Hands-on assessment of CI/CD pipeline setup and management
- Engagement: Self-reported engagement scale (Fredricks et al., 2004)

2.5 Data Analysis
We used independent t-tests to compare post-intervention scores between groups, and paired t-tests to assess within-group improvements. ANCOVA was used to control for pre-test scores.

3. Results

3.1 Knowledge Retention
The serious gaming group showed significantly higher post-test knowledge scores compared to the control group (t(118) = 3.76, p < .001, d = 0.69). ANCOVA results confirmed this difference when controlling for pre-test scores (F(1, 117) = 15.23, p < .001, η²p = 0.12).

3.2 Practical Skills
Students in the serious gaming group demonstrated superior performance in the hands-on assessment (t(118) = 4.22, p < .001, d = 0.77). They completed the CI/CD pipeline setup tasks more quickly and with fewer errors.

3.3 Engagement
The serious gaming group reported significantly higher levels of engagement compared to the control group (t(118) = 5.01, p < .001, d = 0.92).

3.4 Subgroup Analysis
Further analysis revealed that the serious gaming approach was particularly effective for students with lower initial DevOps knowledge (interaction effect: F(1, 116) = 8.45, p = .004, η²p = 0.07).

4. Discussion

Our findings suggest that serious gaming can be an effective approach for teaching DevOps concepts and skills. The significant improvements in both knowledge retention and practical skills among the serious gaming group align with previous research on the benefits of gamification in education (Hamari et al., 2014).

The higher engagement levels reported by students in the serious gaming group may explain part of its effectiveness. The game's interactive nature and immediate feedback mechanisms likely contributed to increased motivation and active learning.

The particular effectiveness of the serious gaming approach for students with lower initial knowledge is noteworthy. This suggests that gamification might be especially beneficial for introducing complex DevOps concepts to novices, potentially lowering the entry barrier to this field.

Limitations of this study include the relatively short intervention period and the focus on undergraduate students. Future research should explore long-term retention and the effectiveness of serious gaming for DevOps training in professional settings.

5. Conclusion

This randomized controlled trial provides evidence for the efficacy of serious gaming in DevOps education. The significant improvements in knowledge retention, practical skills, and student engagement suggest that incorporating gamified elements into DevOps curricula could enhance learning outcomes.

Future research directions include:
1. Developing and testing serious games for specific DevOps tools and practices.
2. Investigating the long-term impact of serious gaming on DevOps skills in professional environments.
3. Exploring the potential of multiplayer serious games to teach DevOps collaboration and communication skills.
